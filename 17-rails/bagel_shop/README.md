RAILS DIFFERENCES
* We use `config/routes.rb` to do all of our routing
* YOU MUST name your controller `bagels_controller.rb`
* ERB files must be named like `bagels/index.html.erb`, note the `html`
* YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLICITLY `render` the following:
  - index
  - show
  - new
  - create
  - edit
  - update
  - destroy
