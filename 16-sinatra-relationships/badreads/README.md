LOOK THIS UP LATER RISHI:
* WHY DO ERB TAGS HAVE TO BE SO DAMN REPETITIVE
* WHY THE HELL DO WE NEED TO REDIRECT
* IT'S 2018 WHY DOESN'T THE BROWSER/HTML SPEC SUPPORT ANYTHING BUT POST


```html
<select name="text"> <!--Supplement an id here instead of using 'text'-->
  <option value="value1">Value 1</option>
  <option value="value2" selected>Value 2</option>
  <option value="value3">Value 3</option>
</select>
```

LOOKS LIKE

```ruby
{ "text" => "value2" }
```
